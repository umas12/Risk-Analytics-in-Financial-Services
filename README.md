# Risk-Analytics-in-Financial-Services

The banks or companies that provide loan find it difficult to lend to people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter.

It would be better if there is a mechanism or a business intelligence that could go through the loan applicants profile and identify patterns that could indicate whether an applicant would be a potential defaulter or non-defaulter, which would greatly help the banks in deciding whom to provide loans, deny the loan, reduce the amount of loan, lend (to risking applicants) at a higher interest rate etc.

This project aims to provide the same facility. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the main criteria of this case study.
